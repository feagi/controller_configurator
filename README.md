# Using the FEAGI Configurator
This application is essentially a stand alone web application, and can be accessed online here.
You can also download the project and run it directly with Godot.

# Contributing
Please see our general contribution guide [here](https://github.com/feagi/feagi/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For working on the Configurator specifically, please download the appropriate Godot editor version [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/) and open a cloned copy of this repository with it. Keep in mind you will require an instance of FEAGI running.

The Configurator builds its templates from "template.json", editing that allows you to edit and create new device types.
